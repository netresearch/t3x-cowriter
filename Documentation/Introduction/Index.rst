What does it do?
================

The AI Cowriter extension integrates multiple LLM providers directly into the
TYPO3 CKEditor, allowing editors to generate content with the help of artificial
intelligence. Using the nr-llm extension, it supports OpenAI, Anthropic Claude,
Google Gemini, OpenRouter, Mistral, and Groq.

Did you ever wish to have a second person to work on a TYPO3 page together with
you? This extension allows you to do exactly that. With the help of AI you can
now work on a page together with a cowriter - a digital assistant that helps you
to write your content.
